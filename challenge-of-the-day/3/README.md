Given two Strings of equal length, 'merge' them into one String.
 
Do this by 'zipping' the Strings together.
 
Start with the first char of the first String.
Then add the first char from the second String.
Then add the second char from the first String.
And so on.
 
Maintain case. You can assume that the string will never contain whitespace.
 
Examples:

zip("String","Fridge") → "SFtrriidngge"

zip("Dog","Cat") → "DCoagt"

zip("True","Tree") → "TTrrueee" 

zip("return","letter") → "rleettutrenr"
